Hi! I'm Brandon!  
  
I know Lua, Haxe, and Javascript.  
  
Some of my favorite projects to work on are:  
https://github.com/brandoge91/funkin-bcb - A engine for the indie game Friday Night Funkin'. I don't work on it much anymore, really only pushing bug patches.  
https://github.com/brandoge91/bigbot - A qBot like discord-roblox bot that has many, many commands+features. It is very advanced in its modularity.  
https://github.com/brandoge91/lobot - A Minecraft: Java Edition bot that can join a server and run commands in chat. Also features discord.js integration for chat and such.
